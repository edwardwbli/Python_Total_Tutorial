python常用于数据操作,在不考虑使用pandas等第三方包的情况下我们的目标是把文件中的表格数据转化为二维列表,这个操作一般可以用以下3种方式:

+ 干读干处理
+ 使用linecache模块读取然后处理
+ 干读+csv模块处理



```python
!ls -lht 
```

```python
!head -n 1 X_train.txt
```

    



```python
def readcache(path,spl):
    import linecache
    temp = linecache.getlines(path)
    result = map(lambda x: x.strip().lstrip().split(spl) ,temp)
    #linecache.clearcache()
    return result
        
```


```python
def readcsv(path,spl):
    import csv
    with open(path, 'rb') as csvfile:
        spamreader = list(csv.reader(csvfile,delimiter=spl))
    return spamreader
```


```python
def read(path,spl):
    with open(path, 'Ur') as f:
        temp = f.readlines()
        result = map(lambda x: x.strip().lstrip().split(spl) ,temp)
    return result
```

> 小文件


```python
%timeit read("iris.data",",")
```

    10000 loops, best of 3: 141 µs per loop



```python
%timeit readcache("iris.data",",")
```

    10000 loops, best of 3: 126 µs per loop



```python
%timeit readcsv("iris.data",",")
```

    The slowest run took 11.54 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
    10000 loops, best of 3: 116 µs per loop


> 10m左右文件


```python
%timeit read('ad.data',",")
```

    10 loops, best of 3: 102 ms per loop



```python
%timeit readcache('ad.data',",")
```

    10 loops, best of 3: 91.7 ms per loop



```python
%timeit readcsv('ad.data',",")
```

    10 loops, best of 3: 151 ms per loop


> 50m左右文件


```python
%timeit read('X_train.txt'," ")
```

    1 loop, best of 3: 419 ms per loop



```python
%timeit readcache('X_train.txt'," ")
```

    1 loop, best of 3: 353 ms per loop



```python
%timeit readcsv('X_train.txt'," ")
```

    1 loop, best of 3: 743 ms per loop


为了防止是缓存内数据重复利用,我们复制X_train.txt然后重命名再做测试


```python
def loopreed(f,paths,spl):
    for path in paths:
        f(path,spl)
```


```python
%timeit loopreed(readcache,["1.txt","2.txt","3.txt","4.txt","5.txt","6.txt"]," ")
```

    1 loop, best of 3: 2.06 s per loop



```python
%timeit loopreed(read,["1.txt","2.txt","3.txt","4.txt","5.txt","6.txt"]," ")
```

    1 loop, best of 3: 2.85 s per loop


最终的结果

分类|第一次|第二次|第三次
---|---|---|---
cache|2.13 |2.07| 2.06
read|2.33| 2.29| 2.3

结论:

可见使用csv包并不能提高处理csv格式文件的效率,而如果文件较大,使用linecache可以提高约10%~15%的i/o效率,
